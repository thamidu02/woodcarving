                     Sri Lanka, which is famous for handicrafts, holds a long history of craft heritage. According to “Mahawamsa” the prevailed arts and crafts were innovated with the arrival of Buddhist Nun “Sanghamitta” to Sri Lanka from India. The history records that crafts men belong to sixty different castes arrived to Sri Lanka along with her on her visit that brought the Sacred Bo- Tree to Anuradhapura.

                        The mask industry can be mentioned as another aspect that shows the uniqueness of Sri Lanka's wood carving art. At a time when the people worshipped trees and animals, masks were an indispensable part of Sri Lankan rituals and ceremonies. Now centuries later they are more of an interesting oddity. However, the traditional mask industry is still a thriving business that continues to fascinate both locals and tourists alike. With their colourful facades, odd shapes and intriguing histories, traditional Sri Lankan masks are commonly found adorning the walls of local houses. They also make excellent souvenirs. All masks have grotesque features that make them all the more interesting. Most masks feature gaping, misshapen mouths; sinister, bulging eyes; and bright, vivid colours. The local masks can be divided into several categories depending on their uses.

                        Some masks are used during ancestor worship, certain spiritual rituals and healing ceremonies. There are masks that are related to hunting, fertility and even exorcism. The exorcism masks are used during funerals and a ritual known as the tovil. Such ceremonies are still held in certain parts of the island and can be quite interesting to watch. Currently, the art of mask making is concentrated among a few families who reside in Ambalangoda, Wathugedara and Benthara as well as some parts along the Western coast. This craftsmanship has been passed from generations within the same families and has been a family trade since its introduction. The timber that is used to make these decorative and colourful masterpieces should always be light and durable and therefore trees such as “Rukkattana” and “Diyakanduru” are used

                        1. Raksha Mask – Used to perform Raksha dances in KolamMaduwa. According to ancient chronicles, Sri Lanka was earlier ruled by a race of Rakshasas (devils) whose king was Ravana of the legend Ramayana. These Rakshasas were able to assume various forms which now the masks depict. There are 24 forms of Rakshasas but only a few are performed in Kolam dance. These masks include the cobra mask, the mask of a bird and the mask of the demon of death.

                    Pottery is one of the oldest handicrafts in Sri Lanka. The primarily utilitarian character of Sri Lankan pottery has been continuing to exist since the very beginning of Aryan Sinhalese civilization of Sri Lanka. The simplicity of ornamentation and charm of the elegance of pottery have held fast in the island for more than a couple of millenniums and a half in Sri Lanka.
                    Low fired cooking pots, cooking pans, jugs, bowls, goblets, tiles, vases, are the most widely used kitchen utensils of Sri Lanka. In addition to the kitchen pots and pans, intricately designed products such as terracotta figures and carved vases too are popular in Sri Lanka. Ornaments such as figurines and delightful animals with distinctly Sinhalese characteristics are also produced at the pottery workshops in the countryside.
